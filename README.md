#hello world

This repo is to create a data base system for the users to keep the record of the chemicals being used in their company. This could help organisations to keep the track of chemicals being used and also helps their employee to be aware of the chemical saftey. This will keep the all details and records of the each chemical. 


We will use django to create the database. All the attributes will be described in the models.py.
